Develop a Hand Gesture Recognition Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a Hand Gesture Recognition model. Below is an overview of the project and how to use it.

Contents

Hand Gesture Recognition Model.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook file where the Hand Gesture Recognition model is implemented.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and image preprocessing techniques.

Model Implementation: Step-by-step construction of a model for gesture recognition.

Visualization: Graphical representation of data augmentations, model performance, and classification results.

Evaluation: Metrics to assess the performance of the model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prerequisites
